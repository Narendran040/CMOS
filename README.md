# Introduction to CMOS design
The CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor) integrated circuit (IC) design process (the design of "chips"). CMOS is
used in most very large-scale integrated (VLSI) or ultra-large-scale integrated (ULSI)
circuit chips. The term "VLSI" is generally associated with chips containing thousands or
millions of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). The term
"ULSI" is generally associated with chips containing billions, or more, MOSFETs.

> Fabrication

CMOS integrated circuits are fabricated on thin circular slices of silicon called wafers.
Each wafer contains several (perhaps hundreds or even thousands) of individual chips or
"die" .
